                    <hr />

                    <p>
                        The powerful combination of cardiovascular exercise and strength training can help a person build muscle strength and improve their heart, lung, and circulatory health.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Exercises that target multiple muscle groups are particularly effective. These include various exercises that require little to no equipment and can suit a range of fitness levels.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Here, we look at 13 of the best exercises for overall health and fitness. We explain what areas of the body each exercise primarily works and provide step-by-step instructions.

                    <h2>Doing the exercises</h2>

                    <p>
                        People can do the following exercises individually or as part of a circuit. Some require basic fitness equipment, such as dumbbells or an exercise ball, but people can do many of them with no equipment. The American
                        Council on Exercise recommend that people continue doing repetitions until they reach muscle fatigue or can no longer maintain proper form.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        However, they note that endurance athletes, such as runners and cyclists, should stick to about 20–30 repetitions rather than working to the point of muscle fatigue. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
                        recommend doing 8–12 repetitions of 8–10 strength training exercises on at least 2 days of the week.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The ACSM also recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a day, 5 days per week. Alternatively, they say that people can perform 20-minute sessions of vigorous physical activity on 3 days
                        of the week.

                    <hr />

                   <p>Pushups work multiple muscle groups, strengthening the arms, chest, and shoulders.</p>
                   <p>How to do them:</p>
                   <p>

                           <li>Start in a plank position with the arms straight and the body lifted in a straight line horizontal to the floor. Keep the feet together and the toes flexed to support the body.</li>
                           <br>
                           
                           <li>The palms should be flat on the floor shoulder-width apart, with the fingers facing straight ahead or slightly inward.</li>
                           <br>

                           <li>Keep the abdominal muscles engaged throughout to help support the back.</li>
                       </ul>

                    <hr />

                   <p>Bodyweight squats can increase lower body and core strength as they work the abs, buttocks, hips, thighs, calves, and shins.</p>
                   <p>How to do them:</p>
                   <p>

                           <br>
                           
                           <li>Push through the feet to straighten back up into the starting position.</li>
                           <br>
                           
                           <li>Inhale into the squat, then exhale when standing back up. </li>
                       </ul>
                   </p>

                   <hr />

                  <p>Lunges work the thighs, buttocks, hips, and abdominal muscles.</p>
                  <p>How to do them:</p>
                  <p>

                  <hr />

                 <p>Side planks help build core strength, which can help reduce lower back pain. Side planks work the buttocks, hips, and abdominal muscles.</p>
                 <p>How to do them:</p>
                 <p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Lie on the right side with the legs outstretched directly on top of each other and the elbow under the shoulder on the right arm.</li>
                         <br>
                         
                         <li>Engage the abdominals and lift the knees and hips off the floor, keeping the head and body aligned.</li>
                         <br>
                         
                         <li>Slowly return to the floor, switch to the left side, and repeat.</li>
                         <br>

                 <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ asset('images/other/gif6.gif') }}" style="width: 900px; object-fit: cover;" alt="" />

                 <hr />

                <p>Planks strengthen the back and abdominal muscles and help build core strength.</p>
                <p>How to do them:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with the elbows and lower arms on the floor, keeping the elbows in line with the shoulders.</li>
                        <br>
                        
                        <li>Lift the body so that it forms a straight line horizontal to the floor.</li>
                        <br>
                        
                        <li>Keep the feet together and the toes flexed to support the body.</li>
                        <br>
                        
                       
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Once people feel strong performing this exercise, they can try a high plank. This move uses the same body positioning, but the person keeps their arms straight with their palms flat on the floor, directly underneath the shoulders.</p>

                <h2>Knee tucks</h2>

                <hr />

               <p>Knee tucks work the abdominals, calves, and shins. People will need an exercise ball, sometimes called a stability ball, for this exercise.</p>
               <p>How to do them:</p>
               <p>
                   <ul>

                       <li>Walk forward on the hands until the knees are resting on the ball and the feet have lifted off the floor. The hands should be directly underneath the shoulders.</li>
                       <br>
                       
                       <li>Slowly push the knees back to return to the starting position.</li>
                       <br>

               <hr />

              <p>The glute bridge is good for the muscles in the back of the body, known as the posterior chai</p>
              <p>How to do them:</p>
              <p>
                  <ul>

                      <br>
                      
                      <li>Contract the buttocks and abdominals to lift the hips off the floor, bringing them in line with the shoulders and knees. Avoid arching the lower back.</li>
                      <br>
                      
                      <li>Slowly lower back to the starting position..</li>
                      <br>

              <hr />

             <p>This exercise helps strengthen the shoulder muscles. People will require two dumbbells.</p>
             <p>How to do them:</p>
             <p>
                 <ul>

                     <li>Engage the abdominal muscles and exhale while extending the arms straight up to lift the dumbbells in a straight line above the shoulders.</li>
                     <br>
