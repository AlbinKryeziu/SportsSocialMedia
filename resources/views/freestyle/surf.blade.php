                        They can only be ridden by experienced and highly skilled surfers, they only break in perfect XXL conditions, and they can take the life of a professional big wave surfer in a split of a second.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        They all share the same passion for chasing the largest winter swells and riding the biggest and heaviest waves in the world.

                        It is an alternative to mainstream team sports, which are more formally organized and largely controlled by adults.

                    <p>
                        In big wave surfing, time and timing are two different things. There's a time to paddle hard and go for it, and then there's the stand-up timing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        First of all, be prepared in all the dimensions that come with it. Then, get the right surf gear, book a jet ski, and find boat support.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The biggest waves in the world can be found and ridden across all continents. With the right swell and wind conditions, you might be lucky enough to ride a couple of monstrous waves.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Some of the most dangerous and extreme surf breaks on the planet come to life dozens or even hundreds of miles offshore in the open ocean and can only be reached by boat or helicopter.

                    <h2>Praia do Norte | Nazaré, Portugal</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ asset('images/surfing/s5.jpeg') }}" style="width: 900px; object-fit: cover;" alt="" />
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        Home to several Guinness World Records - including the largest wave ever ridden and biggest wave ever surfed by a woman - Nazaré's Praia do Norte is a rare natural phenomenon.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Despite being a beach break, it is so powerful and heavy that some call it "the surfboard breaking machine."
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The big waves of Nazaré were first ridden by local bodyboarders and a few international athletes, which include nine-time world bodyboarding champion Mike Stewart.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The highly disputed giants of Praia do Norte are the result of a combination of four variables: swell refraction, rapid depth reduction, converging waves produced by an underwater canyon, and a local water channel.

                    <h2>Jaws/Peahi | Maui, Hawaii</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ asset('images/surfing/s6.jpeg') }}" style="width: 900px; object-fit: cover;" alt="" />
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        At Jaws, also known as Peahi, waves can easily reach between 30 and 80 feet. It is probably the fastest, heaviest, and largest wave in the Pacific Ocean.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The surf break became popular in the 1990s when Laird Hamilton decided to get towed into the wave by a jet ski, using a surfboard equipped with footstraps.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The submerged reef break produces a barreling right-hand and occasionally delivers a few rideable yet dangerous left-handers.

                    <h2>Teahupoo | Tahiti, French Polynesia</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ asset('images/surfing/s7.jpeg') }}" style="width: 900px; object-fit: cover;" alt="" />
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        Teahupoo is one of the heaviest and deadliest waves in the world.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The infamous Tahitian surf break produces a super thick, hollow, and fast-moving barreling wave that breaks over a shallow and sharp reef.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The height of a Teahupoo wave face is between two and three times bigger than the wave's back.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Teahupoo is a freak of nature that comes to life 500 yards off the southern coast of Tahiti and has already claimed the lives of several accomplished surfers.

                    <h2>Shipstern Bluff | Tasmania, Australia</h2>

                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        At Shipstern Bluff, the chances of getting out of there alive on a big day are lower than the chances of riding wipeout-free monsters.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Shipstern Bluff is a mutant wave that creates a wave within a wave due to the shape of the reef bottom. When steps emerge, surfers are forced to handle the jumps as a heavy and fast-breaking lip falls over.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Tasmania's most fearful surf spot can only be accessed by either a 30-kilometer jet ski or a boat ride or a two-hour hike through the Tasman National Park.

                    <h2>Mavericks | Half Moon Bay, California</h2>

                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        Mavericks is a brutal A-frame wave that breaks off Pillar Point, in Half Moon Bay, at Princeton-by-the-Sea, in Northern California.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Mavs is one of the most popular big wave surf spots among heavy chargers because it challenges everyone's anxiety, fear, and confidence levels.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        But there's more. California's liquid, life-and-bone breaker roars to life in cold and shark-infested waters.

                    <h2>Belharra | La Côte Basque, France</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="{{ asset('images/surfing/s10.jpeg') }}" style="width: 900px; object-fit: cover;" alt="" />
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        Belharra is an outer reef break located 2.5 kilometers northwest off the coast of the fishing town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This gigantic A-frame wave breaks over a 15-meter deep, seagrass-covered shoal and can be surfed in low tide.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Although it only breaks a few times per decade, Belharra produces a massive and violent wave with a heavy lip.
